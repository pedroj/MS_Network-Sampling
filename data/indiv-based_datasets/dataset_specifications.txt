 ## Interaction dataset:	

Name of dataset comprises two numbers, first one for study and second for network (in case there is more than one). Numbers are given in "selected_individual_networks.xlsx" and followd by "_int" (e.g. 01_01_int.csv).

First column name is "ind" and has the plant ID.	
Animal species go in columns and their names go in full with "_" in between genus and species.
Non identified species have their own column called "NO_ID".



## Attributes dataset:	

Name of dataset comprises two numbers, first one for study and second for network (in case there is more than one). Numbers are given in "selected_individual_networks.xlsx" and followed by "_attr" (e.g. 01_01_attr.csv).

Relevant attributes to include if available:
"ind" = plant individual ID
"canopy_cover_m2"
"height_cm"	
"crop"	
"d1_cm"	= plant diameter
"d2_cm"	
"trunk_diam" = trunk basal diameter (cm)
"canopy_vol" = Canopy volume in m3

"x" = X coord (longitude)
"y" = Y coord (latitude)
"fruit_d1_mm"	
"fruit_d2_mm"	
"fruit_mass_mg"	
"n_seeds" = mean number of seeds per fruit
"total_seed_weight"
"one_seed_weight"
"pulp_weight"
"fruit_type"	
"fruit_color"	
"protein" = % in dry pulp content
"fibre"   = % in dry pulp content
"lipids"  = % in dry pulp content
"ash"     = % in dry pulp content
"seed_viability" = % viable seeds	
"neigh_radio" = radio in meters in which neighbourhood traits were measured
"neigh_radio_2" = Bigger radio in meters in which more general vegetation context traits were measured
"vegetation_cover" = Percentage of area covered by vegetation in a larger buffer "neigh_radio_2". 
"neigh_fecundity_intra"	
"neigh_fecundity_inter"	
"neigh_density_intra"	
"neigh_density_inter"
"neigh_fecundity_total" = Both intra and inter
"n_inf" = total number of inflorescences	
"nearest_neigh" = distance to de nearest infraspecific individual
"fruiting_length" = fruiting duration in NÂº days
"infra_cover" = human infrastructure cover (i.e., buildings,streets, and roads)

Sampling effort data:
"se_cam_h" = number of hours camera was recording in individual
"se_cam_days" = number of days camera  was recording in individual
"se_bc_area" = area in square meters (m2) of seed-tray(s) located under individual
"se_per_bc_cover" = percentage of plant's cover sampled with barcoding tray
"se_obs_h" = number of hours plant was observed

... etc

Include others relevant traits if available.
